# Welcome to WAYN 

Young adults experience social disconnection when they move from tight-knit school communities into independent adulthood. Friends scatter across cities, schedules don’t align, and relationships are hard to maintain.  

WAYN lets you be there even when you can’t. It’s a location-based social app where friends send each other heartfelt digital gifts tailored to the receiver’s physical location. Users can send lightweight nudge notifications, as well as letters, gift cards, playlists, or audio recordings. These gifts are either received immediately or will be unlocked when the receiver reaches a certain place. Users can also collaborate with friends to send a group gift to a friend. 

## App features
